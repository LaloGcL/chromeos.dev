The following table includes a set of test cases that you can use in your own test plan. The test cases cover a wide array of common scenarios that Android apps should be prepared for if they are expected to run on Chrome OS devices.

| Test type              | Test case                                          | App scenario                   | Success case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|                        | Find app in Play Store                             | All                            | App exists in Play Store, accessed from a Chromebook (no issue if working as intended). **NOTE:** [Flags in your manifest](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element) may cause the app to be unavailable, depending on the hardware in the Chrome OS device. This test is best run on clamshell devices, as they most accurately represent the hardware profile of most devices. |
